# Programming Styles - Course Repository

## Course Objectives

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of lab solutions and in-class exercises for the "Programming Styles" course. The aim is to strengthen programming skills and understanding of fundamental programming language concepts by exploring a multitude of programming styles through constraints imposed on code.

## Course Description

The course embarks on a journey through the landscape of programming languages and idioms, focusing on the art of programming in various styles, independent of the language used. Students fluent in multiple programming languages will learn to program in style, applying different constraints to their code to discover unique styles.

### Pre-requisites

- Fluency in at least two different programming languages, ideally Java and JavaScript.

## Repository Content

- **Lab Solutions:** Each lab focuses on applying multiple programming styles to the TermFrequency task. Solutions are provided in JavaScript and Java.
- **In-Class Exercises:** Brief but insightful exercises to understand theoretical concepts, available in Java, JavaScript, and Python.

## Learning Methods

This course treats programming as an art, encouraging students to practice producing works in multiple styles. The repository contains practical examples and exercises to enhance understanding and proficiency in various programming idioms.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate through Folders:** Each programming language (Java, JavaScript, and Python) has its own folder containing lab solutions and in-class exercises.
2. **Lab Solutions:** Find the TermFrequency task implemented in different styles under the Java and JavaScript folders.
3. **In-Class Exercises:** Explore brief exercises designed to solidify theoretical concepts in the respective language folders.
